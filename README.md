# 🏘️ Real Estate Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This Python project predicts real estate housing prices using the Boston Housing Dataset. The model uses preprocessing pipelines, feature engineering, and Random Forest Regressor from `scikit-learn`.

## 📂 Files Included

- `Real-Estate.py` – Final cleaned model script
- `data.csv` – Dataset (Boston housing)
- `Real-Estate.joblib` – Saved trained model
- `requirements.txt` – Libraries needed to run
- `Real Estate.ipynb` – (Optional) Step-by-step notebook version

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python Real-Estate.py
